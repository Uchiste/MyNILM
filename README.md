# MyNILM
Try to reproduce NILM algorithm with some modification

data_view.ipynb is to understand all the data
preprocessing.ipynb is to preprocess datas for the ML model
Modele_Keras_SmartMeter.ipynb is to create and try the model

At the end, there is a little overfitting but it is acceptable for our project
